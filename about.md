### Hi there 👋, CyberSecurity community, known me as Inva1Id.
I'm a passionate Cybersecurity Blue Team enthusiast with a strong interest in:

🛡️ Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering

🐍 Security Automation (Python, Bash, and PowerShell)

🔍 Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

🧠 Active Directory Penetration Testing & Defense

💻 Endpoint Investigation (Windows, Linux, Memory)

I work with SIEM tools, such as Splunk, ELK, and QRadar, to detect and respond to security incidents.

I enjoy building hands-on skills through labs and real-world scenarios.
I especially like doing challenges from [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org) and writing detailed write-ups to share my investigations and learnings.
